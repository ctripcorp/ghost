# ghost
A set of go tools with simple construction and powerful features.  
As _ghost_ is forced to be external depandency free, 
it is easy to run go codes with _ghost_ without downloading varieties of extra libs.
This implies that _ghost_ might be a best solution for internal enterprise servers with internet cut off
or some users who have harsh conditions to access abroad, especially CHN developers.
